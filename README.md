# Pong in Unity

Code based on the Zigurous's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpaYq0ihaM

The only difference is that I added the `Invoke` (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Invoke.html) to call `Ball.AddStartingForce`. I made this so the players can have some time before jumping right to the game.
